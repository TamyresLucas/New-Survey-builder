# App Changelog - 2025-12-02

## 1. Refine Logic Card UI

**Time**: 10:39 AM (Approximate)

**Written Request**:
> Refine Logic Card UI
> Update Logic Card Titles: Change the font weight of logic card titles (Display Logic, Skip Logic, Branching Logic) to semibold.
> Update Choice Variables Styling: Change the font weight of choice variables in the survey canvas to semibold and ensure they maintain the same color as the surrounding text.

**Improvements**:
- **Logic Card Typography**: Updated the font weight of logic card titles (Display Logic, Skip Logic, Branching Logic) to semibold for better hierarchy.
- **Choice Variable Styling**: Choice variables in the survey canvas now use semibold weight and inherit the surrounding text color, improving readability and consistency.

**Written Request**:
> Rename "Copy and paste" Button: Change the label of the "Copy and paste" button to "Paste" in general settings.
> Relabel "Paste" Button in Behavior Tab: Specifically, within the Behavior tab, change the label of the "Paste" button to "Write expression" and ensure it displays a pencil icon.
