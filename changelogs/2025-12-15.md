## 1. Blueprint UI Refinements & Build Panel Search

**Time**: 2:10 PM

**Written Request**:
> Refine Blueprint UI Actions, Add Back to Top, and Enhance Build Panel Search.

**Improvements**:
- **Blueprint Actions**: Simplified the main survey actions dropdown by removing nested print menus. Replaced the "Print Blueprint" button with a comprehensive "Export blueprint" dropdown supporting Word, Excel, HTML, and Print options.
- **Back to Top**: Moved the "Back to top" functionality to the main left navigation rail. It is now a discreet, icon-only button that works consistently across both Blueprint and Design views, allowing users to quickly return to the top of their workspace.
- **Build Panel Search**: Transformed the Search tab into a toggleable magnifying glass icon. This allows users to toggle the search bar on and off while maintaining their context within the Toolbox, Content, or Library tabs.
- **Layout Polish**: Refined the Build Panel layout so that dropdown fields dynamically adjust their spacing ("hug" the top) when the search bar is hidden, maximizing vertical space.

**Technical Changes**:
- **Updated `SubHeader.tsx`**: Flattened the print menu structure.
- **Updated `BlueprintCanvas.tsx`**: Implemented the new Export dropdown logic and relabeled "Select all" to "Export all".
- **Updated `LeftSidebar.tsx`**: Integrated the `ArrowUpIcon` button and robust scroll-to-top logic targeting multiple container IDs.
- **Updated `BuildPanel.tsx`**: Added `isSearchVisible` state, converted the search tab to a toggle button, and applied conditional margins to dropdowns.
- **Updated `App.tsx`**: Added `id="main-canvas-scroll-container"` to ensure global scroll targeting works correctly.
