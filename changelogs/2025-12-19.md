## 🎨 UI & UX Improvements

### Question Editor
- **Settings Tab Cleanup**: Removed redundant "Question Text" and "Choices" editors from the Settings tab to focus on configuration.
- **Behavior Tab Layout**: 
    - Removed the "Set question randomization" button.
    - Relocated the "Question Group" section to the bottom of the pane, separated by a divider.
- **Preview Synchronization**:
    - Synced the "Edit Question > Preview" tab to use the exact same mobile rendering component as the main Survey Preview.
    - Implemented a **responsive mobile preview** in the sidebar that automatically scales down to fit the available screen height without scrolling.
    - Enforced fixed dimensions (300px x 670px) for the mobile mockup to ensure consistent aspect ratio and sizing across the app.

### Survey Canvas (Choices)
- **Visual Alignment**: Aligned Radio Buttons and Checkboxes to sit perfectly flush with the Question Text and Variable label.
- **Multi-line Text**: Enabled text wrapping for long choice labels, ensuring they hug the text properly while maintaining icon alignment with the first line.
- **Icons**: 
    - Updated the "Allow Text Entry" icon to `OpenEndAnswerIcon` to match the Toolbox.
    - Repositioned the choice drag handle to appear to the left of the alignment line on hover.

### Settings Cleanup
- **Choice Grid**: Removed the "Columns" interface from the Settings tab to simplify the configuration view.
- **Selection Options**: Removed the "Multiple selection" toggle from Radio Button and Checkbox settings as it was redundant for those specific types.

## 🔗 Logic & connectivity
- **Survey Flow Diagram**:
    - **Smart Connectivity**: Implemented context-aware branching logic where questions in one branch "skip over" sibling branches and correctly merge into the next neutral block.
    - **Refined Conditional Blocks**: Updated the flow engine to only mark explicit "Branch Targets" as exclusive. "Otherwise" paths and Simple Skips now correctly preserve downstream connectivity (e.g., merging back to a common page).
    - **Cleaner Visuals**: Removed "Otherwise" labels from unconditional or redundant skip logic edges, displaying them as simple directional connections for a cleaner graph.

## 🛠️ System
- **Autosave**: Fixed `localStorage` persistence and restored the "Saved at" timestamp to accurately reflect background saves.
- **Publish Workflow**: Refined the Publish action to automatically transition surveys from 'Draft' to 'Active' upon publishing.
