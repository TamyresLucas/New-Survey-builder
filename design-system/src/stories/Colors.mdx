# Shadcn Color Tokens Reference Table

The following table lists the core color tokens used in the design system, along with their HSL values for both Light and Dark modes.

### **Key Usage Principles**

- **Background/Foreground Pairing**: Each color token with a background purpose has a corresponding `-foreground` variant to ensure readable text contrast.
- **Semantic Naming**: Token names reflect their purpose (primary, destructive, muted) rather than their appearance (blue, red, gray).
- **Theme Inversion**: Notice how primary and foreground colors swap between light and dark modes to maintain proper contrast.
- **Consistent References**: Components always reference these tokens rather than hard-coded colors, enabling automatic theme switching.
