This is a dummy file created to test the Azure DevOps build and release pipeline.

Test Details:
- Date: December 18, 2025
- Purpose: Verify end-to-end CI/CD pipeline
- Expected outcome: Build triggers, artifact is created with proper structure, and deployment succeeds

Pipeline Flow:
1. Commit triggers build on master branch
2. npm install runs
3. npm run build creates dist folder with base path /SurveyBuilderPoc/
4. web.config is copied to dist
5. Dist folder contents are archived to survey-builder.zip (contents at root)
6. Artifact is published as 'survey-builder-dist'
7. Release pipeline deploys to IIS

Expected artifact structure:
- survey-builder.zip
  - index.html
  - web.config
  - assets/
    - index-[hash].js

This file can be deleted after successful testing.
